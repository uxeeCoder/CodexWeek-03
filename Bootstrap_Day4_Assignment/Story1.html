      <p style="text-align: justify">
        Once upon a time there was the most beautiful princess ever, who lived
        in a castle far far away. She was very lonely and wanted to find a
        prince to marry. She had a magic mirror that she would talk to every
        day. She would ask the mirror, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the
        fairest of them all?" The mirror would always reply, "You are the
        fairest of them all, my princess." The princess was happy with this
        answer, but she wanted to find a prince to marry. One day, the princess
        was walking in the forest and she saw a handsome prince riding on a
        white horse. She fell in love with him instantly and asked him to marry
        her. The prince said yes and they lived happily ever after.
