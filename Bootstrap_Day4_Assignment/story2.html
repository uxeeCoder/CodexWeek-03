        Once upon a time there lived a giant in a castle. His castle was built
        in a far far away land, so far away that no one could reach there ever.
        One day the giant went outside for a stroll and he found a small boy
        sitiiing on a rock. Giant was too suprised to see him there so he slowly
        approached the boy and asked him gentaly how he ended up in this far
        away land and boy was not afraid to see a giant standing next to him.
